### Aim
The aim of the Ebola Ghana Alert initiative is to provide people in Ghana with a reliable and easy-to-use application for the tracking, training and disseminating of information to the general public about the Ebola virus. The virus has claimed thousands of lives in West Africa alone, and we would like to take action to stop Ebola from spreading. We created the platform with professionals of varied backgrounds, to ensure a disciplinary understanding as how best to implement precautionary measures for our country.
### Goals
+ To provide up-to-date and accurate information and updates about the ebola virus
+ To utilize technology to spread information about ebola in a highly accessible way, for everyone in Ghana regardless of socio-economic backgrounds.
+ To enable easy access to emergency medical assistance in suspected cases of Ebola patients.
