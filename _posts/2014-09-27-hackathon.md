title: "Ebola Ghana Task Force "
---

On Friday, August 29th, a group of developers, technologists, health professionals and change makers joined forces at iSpace and put their heads together. And Ebola Ghana Alert was born.

The aim of this initiative is to provide people in Ghana with a reliable and easy-to-use application for the tracking, training and disseminating of information to the general public about the Ebola virus. The virus has claimed thousands of lives in West Africa alone, and we would like to take action to stop Ebola from spreading. We created the platform with professionals of varied backgrounds, to ensure a disciplinary understanding as how best to implement precautionary measures for our country.

Please join us in spreading the word!
