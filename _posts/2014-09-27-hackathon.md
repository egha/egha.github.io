The 2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak has claimed a suspected 1552 lives. No doubt, very scary.

We are confronted with information on the news, twitter, whatsapp, at school, church and word of mouth. But what is real? And whom can we trust? Though Ebola is not in Ghana, what measures do we have in place to make sure we are safe?

We are trying to change that.

On Friday, August 29th, a group of developers, technologists, health professionals and change makers joined forces at iSpace and put their heads together. And Ebola Ghana Alert was born.

The aim of this initiative is to provide people in Ghana with a reliable and easy-to-use application for the tracking, training and disseminating of information to the general public about the Ebola virus. The virus has claimed thousands of lives in West Africa alone, and we would like to take action to stop Ebola from spreading. We created the platform with professionals of varied backgrounds, to ensure a disciplinary understanding as how best to implement precautionary measures for our country. 

The goals of this initiative are threefold:

First is to provide up-to-date and accurate information and updates about the Ebola virus. Second is to utilize technology to spread information about Ebola in a highly accessible way, for everyone in Ghana regardless of socio-economic background. And finally, to enable easy access to emergency medical assistance in suspected cases of Ebola patients.

There are a few ways to access this information:

1) Stay in tune with the application at www.ebolaghanaalert.org
2) Simply dial *713*444# on your MTN or Airtel and receive up-to-date information 
3) ‘Like’ the ‘Ebola Ghana Alert’ facebook page 
4) Follow @ebolaghanaalert on twitter

Please join us in spreading the word!
